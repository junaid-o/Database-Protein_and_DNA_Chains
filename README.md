# Database of Isolated Protein Chains and DNA Chains


## Description

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive database created as part of an M Tech project, focused on DNA, protein, and complex structures. The repository contains a collection of CSV files, each dedicated to specific categories such as DNA, protein, DNA-protein complexes, peptides, ribozymes, and more. These CSV files are meticulously curated and provide essential information in a structured format.


The repository includes PDB files specifically focused on isolated chains of DNA and proteins. These chains are extracted from the extensive collection of PDB files available in the RCSB (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics) database. By isolating these chains, researchers can study individual molecular components, gaining insights into their unique characteristics and behaviors.

This database serves as a valuable asset for scientists, bioinformaticians, and students involved in structural biology, molecular biology, and related fields. It aims to simplify the process of accessing, analyzing, and understanding DNA, protein, and complex structures, promoting further research and discovery in the fascinating realm of molecular sciences.
